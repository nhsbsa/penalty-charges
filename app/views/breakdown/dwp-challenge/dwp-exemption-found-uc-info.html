        How to avoid further enquiry letters
      </h3>
        
        <p>We match exemptions using a combination of your:</p>
      
      <ul class="list list-bullet">
        <li>
          name
        </li>
       <li>
         address
        </li>
                 <li>
         date of birth
        </li>
        
         
          </li>
      </ul>
        
        <p>Make sure these are correct at your GP surgery, dental practice, and any benefits organisations have your correct details.</p>
     
        <p>Keep your details up to date or you may receive further enquiry letters in the future.</p>
        <h3 class="heading-medium">Important information for any future claims</h3> 
        <div class="panel panel-border-wide">
          
              <p>Your Universal Credit exemption must have been valid at the time you claim help with your health costs.<p> 
              
            <p>Check that you are still entitled to free prescriptions or dental care before making a claim.</p>
            You are entitled to claim free prescriptions if your earnings in the last assessment period were:<p>
              <ul class="list list-bullet">
                <li>£435 or less</li>
                <li>£935 or less if your Universal Credit includes a payment for a child or you have limited capability for work or work-related activity.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If you claim Universal Credit as a couple, the earnings limit applies to the joint income of you and your partner</p>
