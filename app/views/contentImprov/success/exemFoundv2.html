         <p>The details on your exemption certificate do not match those taken from your prescription. Checks for exemptions are done automatically using these details from your prescription:</p>
         <ul class="list list-bullet">
            <li>
               <span class="bold">Name</span>
               <p>Your name on your certificate may have been different to the one on your prescription.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
               <span class="bold">Address</span>
               <p>Your address on your certificate may have been different to the one on your prescription.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
               <span class="bold">Date of birth</span>
               <p>Your date of birth on your certificate may have been different to the one on your prescription.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
               <span class="bold">NHS number</span>
               <p>Your NHS number may have been missing from your prescription.</p>
            </li>
         <p>Make sure these are correct on your NHS exemption certificate, and at your GP surgery, dental practice, and any benefits organisations. If they’re not, you might get another Penalty Charge Notice.</p>

<!--          <p>Checks for exemptions are done automatically using details from your prescription. It could be that one or more of these details differ on your exemption certiicate or your exemption certificate number was not previously available to us.</p>

         <p style="font-weight: bold;">Name</p>
         <p>If your name has changed or your name differs on your exemption certificate, this will result in a mismatch.</p>
         <p style="font-weight: bold;">Address</p>
         <p>If your address has changed or your address differs on your exemption certificate, this will result in a mismatch.</p>

         <p>If your date of birth differs on your exemption certificate, this will result in a mismatch.</p>
