        How to avoid a future enquiry letter
      </h3>
        
        <p>We match exemptions automatically using a combination of your:</p>
      
      <ul class="list list-bullet">
        <li>
          name
        </li>
       <li>
         address
        </li>
                 <li>
         date of birth
        </li>
        
         
          </li>
      </ul>
        
        <p>Make sure these are correct at your GP surgery, dental practice, and any benefits organisations.</p>
        
  




        
        
        <p>If any of your details are not up to date, you may receive another enquiry letter in the future.</p>
        <details>
          <summary><span class="summary"> Are you on Universal Credit? Important information for any future claims</span></summary>
          <div class="panel panel-border-narrow">
              
              <p>Your universal credit exemption must have been valid at the time you claimed a free prescription or dental treatment.<p> 
              
            <p>For any future claims you must check again that you are entitled to free prescriptions or dental care at that time. This will be if your earnings during that assessment only were:</p>
            435 or less<p>
              £935 or less if your universal credit includes a payment for a child or you have limited capability for work or work-related activity.<P></P>
              "Last assessment period" means the assessment period that ended immediately before the date you claimed free treatment.<p><p></p>
              If you claim universal credit as a couple, the earnings limit applies to the joint income of you and your partner.
